# Quick Start for Segmentation Model (U-Net)
This repository includes all processes of building a segmentation model, from dataset creation to model training.  
Due to the time of interest, I used ArcGIS Pro to label the images. And the training result is unsatisfactory, because of the inaccuracy label, too many categories and high density in Hong Kong.  
  
However, if you want to quickly start training a segmentation model with your own dataset, this repository will suit you.
